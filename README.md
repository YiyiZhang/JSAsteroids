# JSAsteroids

  JSAsteroids is an implementation of the classic game Asteroids in pure JS and HTML5. It uses an HTML5 canvas element to draw the visual effects, and implements class-style inheritance for a number of Javascipt object prototypes.

### Object Class Prototypes
  - Game - Manages game stats and time steps
  - GameView - Renders the game into the page
  - MovingObject - Manages functions for all moving object type.
  - Ship - Ship Object
  - Bullet - Bullet Object
  - Asteroid - Asteroid object, takes a config hash and can represent asteroids with different stats and sprites, making it simple to add additional asteroid types.
